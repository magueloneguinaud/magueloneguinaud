# Welcome to my Github, Who I am ?

👋My name is Maguelone and I'm a student at the [Ada Tech School](https://adatechschool.fr/) studying to become a developer. 

👉After more than 5 years in event catering and 10 years in the recruitment sector, I had the opportunity to retrain, and the @Ada Tech School team was the first to have confidence in me and support me in the transition.

👉I'm a curious person who likes to share, exchange...and I love to eat and dance. 😉🍱💃

👉I'm also a volunteer. It's a way for me to give my time and share with others. I find it broadens your horizons and makes you more open-minded. 
So I take part in one-off events and I'm involved all year with the Marraine & Vous association (which puts single mums in touch with sponsor families). 

🤔Why did you decide to change careers? I've been fascinated by this sector for a long time, so I decided to take the plunge and make a real contribution, at my level, to changing things... for the better, if possible!

👩‍💻Which technologies? At this stage, I'm interested in everything because I want to see and test lots of things to find out what suits me best... so I'm very open and I'm testing different languages and frameworks.

🕵️‍♀️What I'm looking for? A company that trusts me and will support me in this change of direction!
